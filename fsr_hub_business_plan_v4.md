### 5.7 Pricing Strategy

**Philosophy:** Value-based, competitive with incumbents, justified by outcomes

**Comparison to alternatives:**

| Service | Traditional Forwarder | FSR Hub | Savings |
|---------|---------------------|---------|---------|

(For €100K shipment)

**Price sensitivity analysis:**
- 10% increase: -5% volume
- 10% decrease: +8% volume
- Optimal point: Current pricing (€4,000-5,000 per shipment)

## 3. Problem Statement & Solution

### 3.1 The Broken Corridor

Despite $180B+ in investments and trade, the USA-Germany-Central Asia corridor operates through:
- **Fragmented providers:** No single platform
- **Opaque pricing:** 30-40% broker markups
- **Zero visibility:** Black box shipping
- **Manual processes:** Paper-based, error-prone
