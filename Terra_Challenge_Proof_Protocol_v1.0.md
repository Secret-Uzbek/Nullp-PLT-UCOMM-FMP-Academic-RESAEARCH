## Abstract
This protocol defines a proof-generation and publication workflow for the **Terra Challenge Initiative**, a Fractal Metascience approach (FMP) that applies the Nullo analytic method to major unresolved scientific challenges. The document provides a reproducible, publication-ready procedure for transforming simulations, conjectures, and experimental outputs into citable artifacts appropriate for journals, preprint servers (arXiv, Zenodo), and prize competitions. It is written to meet academic standards (APA7-style structure), include evidence-tracing, and produce the "regalia" and recognition needed for governmental and institutional adoption.

**Keywords:** Fractal Metascience, Nullo, proof protocol, Terra, experimental articles, Zenodo, academic publishing, challenge competitions.

## 1. Purpose and Scope
The Terra Challenge Proof Protocol (TCPP) v1.0 formalizes how Terra/Nullo research outcomes are converted into verifiable, publishable artifacts and into submissions for competitive prizes. Its primary goals:
1. Ensure each claim is traceable to data, simulation parameters, and at least three supporting scholarly sources or reproducible logs.
2. Create standardized templates for experimental articles, proofs-of-concept, and evidence packages acceptable by journals, funding bodies, and prize committees.
3. Establish an immutable provenance ledger (Terra Proof Ledger) with DOIs, timestamps and cryptographic checksums for major deliverables.

This protocol applies to conceptual, computational, and experimental results generated within the Terra ecosystem that aim for public archival, peer review, or prize submission.

## 2. Definitions
- **Nullo:** the analytic reflective operator in FMP that decomposes assumptions and reconstructs problem lattices via fractal mapping.
- **Proof Artifact:** any document or dataset (paper, preprint, simulation archive) intended to demonstrate new knowledge or partial solution.
- **Terra Proof Ledger:** an open registry of artifacts with metadata, checksums, DOIs and version history.
- **Fractal Decomposition:** methodology of splitting an original problem into hierarchical sub-problems across scales and modalities.
- **Experimental Article:** descriptive, reproducible report documenting methods, data, simulations, results and interpretation (IMRaD where applicable).

---

## 3. High-level Protocol Overview
1. **Problem Ingestion:** capture canonical problem statement (source, date, institution). Example: Millennium Prize description, XPRIZE track, official contest rules.
2. **Fractal Mapping (Nullo Process):** create a Fractal Problem Graph (FPG) — nodes: assumptions, known results, known counterexamples, computational constraints.
3. **Simulation & Evidence Generation:** run Terra simulations, record seed, random states, software versions, hardware specifications, and raw outputs.
4. **Claim Formulation:** from simulations and analysis, articulate explicit claims (theorems, conjectures, empirical findings) with clearly bounded scope and failure modes.
5. **Support Collection:** for each claim, attach (a) reproducible code & environment, (b) datasets & logs, (c) at least 3 supporting references or primary data sources.
6. **Artifact Assembly:** prepare an Experimental Article + Supplementary Materials + Data Archive; validate packaging with checklist (see Appendix A).
7. **Registration & Archival:** deposit artifact in Terra Proof Ledger, Zenodo (or institutional repository), and mint DOI. Publish preprint (arXiv, ResearchGate) where appropriate.
8. **Submission & Outreach:** prepare submission to journals or challenge committees; simultaneously craft public communication (press-release, executive summary) suitable for governmental stakeholders.
9. **Recognition Loop:** upon acceptance or award, update Terra Proof Ledger, issue Proof Token (registry entry), and propagate credits to TerraPedia / CVs.

## 4. Detailed Steps and Templates

### 4.1 Problem Ingestion
- Record canonical statement: title, institution, URL, date, prize rules, accepted submission formats, deadlines.
- Create `ingestion.json` with fields: `problem_id`, `canonical_text`, `source`, `prize_amount`, `submission_deadline`, `eligibility_constraints`.

### 4.2 Fractal Mapping (Nullo)
- Build Fractal Problem Graph (FPG) as JSON-LD. Nodes labeled with:
  - `assumption`, `lemma`, `experiment`, `counterexample`, `computational_limit`.
- Each edge annotated with `confidence`, `supported_by` (list of refs or logs), and `scale` (micro/meso/macro).
- Output file: `FPG_problem_<id>.jsonld`.

### 4.3 Simulation & Evidence Generation
- All computational work must include:
  - Hardware profile: CPU/GPU, RAM, OS, and cluster identifiers.
  - Software profile: exact package versions, container image hash (if any).
  - Random seeds and deterministic configuration where applicable.
  - Raw logs and processed outputs saved with SHA256 checksums.
- Use reproducible packaging: Docker/Singularity image or a bindable environment specification (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `conda.yaml`, `environment.lock`).

### 4.4 Claim Formulation Template
- Title of claim (short)
- Statement (formal natural-language + symbolic form where applicable)
- Scope and Preconditions
- Failure Modes (explicit)
- Evidence Summary (link to log files, figures)
- Supporting References (minimum 3)
- Suggested review questions for peer reviewers

### 4.5 Artifact Assembly — Article Template (Experimental Article)
- Title, authors (with ORCID), affiliations.
- Abstract (≤250 words)
- Keywords
- Introduction (background, problem framing)
- Methods (detailed — reproducible protocol)
- Results (figures with captions, tables)
- Discussion (interpretation, limitations)
- Conclusion (succinct)
- Acknowledgements (funding, contributors)
- Data & Code Availability Statement (links + DOI)
- References (APA7 or journal-specific)
- Supplementary Materials (bundled as `supplementary.zip`)

Use the provided LaTeX template `tcp_protocol_article.tex` (APA7-compatible).

## 5. Validation Criteria (Minimum Standards)
For a claim to be considered publishable and competitive for prizes, it must meet:

1. **Traceability:** Every major assertion linked to raw data or a referenced source (link + SHA256).
2. **Reproducibility:** Code or container provided; at least one independent run reproduced by second party (or CI).
3. **Support Count:** Each new factual claim supported by at least **three** distinct scholarly sources OR by two sources + primary data produced by Terra.
4. **Robustness:** Sensitivity analysis across parameter ranges; report showing stability or boundary conditions.
5. **Ethical Compliance:** No use of proprietary data without consent; experiments with humans/animals follow approved protocols.

## 6. Publication & Competition Pipeline

### 6.1 Journals and Preprints
- Preprint: arXiv or Zenodo deposit before/at submission.
- Target journals: choose tiered list (Field-specific top-tier, then reputable open-access journals).
- Include a cover letter addressing novelty, reproducibility steps, and Terra/Nullo methodology.

### 6.2 Prize Submissions
- Translate proof artifact into the prize submission format (executive summary, technical appendix).
- Include third-party endorsements when available (letters from collaborating labs or experts).
- Track submission via `submissions.csv` with status, dates, and contacts.

### 6.3 Media & Government Engagement
- Prepare an Executive Summary (1–2 pages) framed for policymakers.
- Prepare a press-ready one-page brief and one short explainer video script.
- Schedule briefings with governmental contacts (IT-Park, Ministry of Digital Technologies) timed after preprint release.

---

## 7. Terra Proof Ledger & Proof Tokens
- Each archived artifact receives:
  - DOI (Zenodo / other repository)
  - SHA256 checksum of the artifact bundle
  - Terra Proof Token (human-readable registry entry: `TERRA-PROOF-YYYY-NNN`)
  - Attribution metadata (authors, ORCID, contributors)
- Ledger is public and append-only. For higher security, a signed Merkle-tree snapshot is produced for each monthly release.

---

## 8. Licensing, IP and Ethics
- Default licensing: **Documents** — CC BY-SA 4.0; **Code** — MIT. Exceptions require explicit consent.
- IP Strategy: For prize-driven IP, adopt dual-track: public research artifacts (open) + commercialization-ready modules (patent or commercial licenses).
- Ethics board review must be registered for any human-subjects or interspecies experiments.

---

## 9. Suggested Tools and Repositories
- Repro packaging: Docker, Singularity, or Nix.
- Data repositories: Zenodo, OSF, institutional repositories.
- Code hosting: GitHub/GitLab with archived releases.
- Continuous integration: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for reproducibility checks.
- Ledger: simple JSON registry with monthly Merkle snapshots; optional blockchain anchoring for public attestation.
